Ember.js-in-Action-Source
=========================

This is the code examples from Ember.js in Action. The code is split up into the following: 

- Chapter 1 code is used for both chapter 1 and chapter 2. Live Demo: http://stuff.haagen.name/notes/index.html
- Chapter 3 code is located in the chapter 3 directory. 
- Chapter 4 does not have any associated source code. 
- Chapter 5, 7, 8, 9 and 11 uses the Montric application as its source: http://github.com/joachimhs/Montric
- Chapter 6 uses the Ember Fest website as its source: http://github.com/joachimhs/EmberFestWebsite

The code is split up into multiple parts. The complete source code is split up into multiple files and are linked up inside index.html. Where the chapters code is split into multiple major parts, each of these parts are included inside a single file containing the complete JavaScript code. The first part is named "app1.js", the second "app2.js" and so on. These files are linked up via their corresponding "index1.html", "index2.html" and so on. 

The code is structured in such a way that you are able to run the code example by simply opening the index.html file you want to run in your browser. 

Note
====

Because the code uses console.log statements directly in the code, you need to enable the developer tools in order to view the code examples in Internet Explorer version 7 or 8.
